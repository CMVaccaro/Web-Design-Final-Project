    <td><h2>Go on a Safari</h2>
    Seriously, I've had friends who've been and got so close to an elephant they were worried about being trampled.  I've seen exotic animals in the zoo, but thats no fun, im ready to see them in their own homes, and maybe get some ivory as a take home present.  Just kidding....</td>

    <td><h2> Run a Half Marathon</h2>
    I remember the story my dad told about my first mile run in school; the girl on crutches passed me, so I'm not athletic I get it, but maybe if I work hard one day I'll actually be able to do this.  Or at least a 5k.</td>

    <td><h2> Go to Germany </h2>
    I was lucky enough to study abroad last semester, and get a lot of my traveling done. But on of my biggest regrets is I didn't go to Germany.  Supposedly some part of my family originated there, so I feel obligated to go to the mother-land.  Oh and go to Oktoberfest.</td>
