    <td><h2> Go to Greece </h2>
    I went to Greece last spring and had the time of my life. Fortunately I was lucky enough to spend it with my girlfriend an we had the most amazing, special time ever. The water was clear, the sky was blue, and the wine was plentiful. The food was more amazing than I ever expected and I cannot wait to go back again.
