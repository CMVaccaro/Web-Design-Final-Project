Hi! I'm Cara, I'm in my senior year of college and my 22nd birthday is on the horizon. I know, depressing, I've heard a rumor that life sucks after college. So in order to make sure my life is still full of fun experiences I decided to start with a bucket list. I have done so much in my 21 years but there are still so many things I want to do and so many places I want to go. The rest of my site is divided into 4 main sections: I have the actual list, what I've managed to complete so far, a place for you to leave me suggestions, and famous feats that ÃŸhave been performed by others. I hope this inspires you to go reach your goal! Stay adventerous my friend,
</p>
<p>xoxo</p>
